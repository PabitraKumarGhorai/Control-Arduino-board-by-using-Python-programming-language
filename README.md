# Control-Arduino-board-by-using-Python-programming-language
Arduino board is a microcontroller device, generally we code Arduino by using Arduino IDE and we use C++ language to code Arduino. In this GitHub Repository I am showing you how to code Arduino by using python language.

For code Arduino in python language you need to follow some steps given below:

1. Install Arduino IDE in your computer link: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software.
2. Install python IDE (link:https://www.python.org/downloads/)/Anaconda (link:https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) in your computer (Here I use Anaconda).
3. Install pyfirmata and pySerial in your Anaconda by opening anaconda prompt.
4. In the anaconda prompt you need to write "conda install -c conda-forge pyfirmata" for pyfirmata & write "conda install -c anaconda pyserial" for pyserial.
5. Now connect you Arduino with your pc & open Arduino IDE.
6. In Arduino IDE you need to open example -> Firmata -> StandardFirmata and upload this code on your Arduino board.
7. Now open your Spyder in Anaconda.
8. Check the ports where Arduino is connected.
9. Now paste my python code on spyder IDE and run this you are good to go.
